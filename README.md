# My Portfolio
### Who am I?
Hello, I am Samuel Tarifa Flores, a person who codes mostly for fun (and also to get a job). My main objective right now is to keep developing my skills (coding, 3D modeling, and video editing mainly). The reason for that is that I am a person who likes to do things overall. Right now, my two main projects are:
  - To develop my video game
  - To keep on creating content for my YouTube channel

However, until I can actually start living off of those, I first need to get a job that will support me financially. For that, I am still studying to gain more knowledge. Right now, I have:
  - Technician in Microinformatic Systems and Networks
  - CISCO
  - Technician in Development of Web Applications (In progress)

# My experience with coding
I first started coding when I was thirteen years old. I tried to learn C# to create video games in Unity, but my PC was too old for that, so I eventually stopped due to hardware limitations. After this, when I was 16, I tried to create a video game again, this time in Godot. With a new PC, it was finally possible since I didn't lack the hardware to do so. In Godot, I learned GDScript, a programming language created specifically for Godot. GDScript is basically C++ but with all of the functionalities from the Godot engine integrated.

While I am very good at coding, I am still working on 3D modeling, so I have had to delay the video game.
