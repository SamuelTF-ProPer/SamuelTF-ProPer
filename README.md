### Who am I?
Hello, Iam Samuel Tarifa Flores a person who codes mostly for fun (and also to get a job). My main objective right now is to keep developing my skills (Coding, 3D modeling and video editing mainly) The reason for that is that I am a person who likes to do things overall, right now my two main projects are:
  - To develop my videogame
  - To keep on creating content for my youtube chanel

However until i can actually start living off of those i first need to get a job that will support me financially, for that i am still studiying to get more knoledge. Right now I have:
  - Technician in microinformatic systems and networks
  - CISCO
  - Technician in development of web aplications (In progress)

### My experience at coding
I first started coding when i was thirteen years old, I tried to learn C# to create videogames in Unity but my PC was too old for that so i eventually stopped due to hardware limitations. After this when i was 16 i tried to create a videogame again, this time in Godot, with a new PC it was finally posible since i didnt lack the hardware to do so. In Godot i learned GDScript a programming language created specifically for Godot, GDScript is basically C++ but with all of the funcionalities from the Godot engine integrated, while I am very good at coding I still am working on 3D modeling so I have had to delay the videogame
